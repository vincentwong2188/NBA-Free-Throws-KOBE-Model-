# NBA-Free-Throws-KOBE-Model-
Created a model to predict the free throw percentage of NBA players using the features and factors found in an NBA Free Throws Kaggle dataset of over 600000 data points.  

The model is an adaptation of the K-Nearest Neighbours scatter model, and works well with predicting two quantitative and two qualitative features at the same time. 

The prediction model was coded with Python and Pandas.
